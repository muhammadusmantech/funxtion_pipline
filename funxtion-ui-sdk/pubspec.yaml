  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons_svg/
    - assets/logo.png
    
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:  
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf           
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf                    
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf       
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf                      
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Thin.ttf
